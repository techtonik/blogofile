Welcome to Blogofile
====================

Blogofile is a static website compiler, primarily (though not exclusively) designed to be a simple blogging engine. It requires no database and no special hosting environment. You customize a set of templates with `Mako <http://www.maktotemplates.org>`_, create posts in a markup language of your choice (see :ref:`post-content`) and Blogofile renders your entire website as static HTML and Atom/RSS feeds which you can then upload to any old web server you like. 

Why you should consider Blogofile
=================================

* Blogofile is **free open-source** software, released under a non-enforced `MIT License`_.
* Blogofile sites are **fast**, the web server doesn't need to do any database lookups nor any template rendering.
* Blogofile sites are **inexpensive** to host. Any web server can host a blogofile blog.
* Blogofile is **modern**, supporting all the common blogging features:

 * Categories and Tags.
 * Comments, Trackbacks, and Social Networking mentions (Twitter,
   Reddit, FriendFeed etc), all with effective spam filtering using
   `Disqus <http://www.disqus.com>`_.
 * RSS and Atom feeds, one for all your posts, as well as one per
   category. Easily create additional feeds for custom content.
 * Syntax highlighting for source code listings.
 * Ability to create or share your own plugins in your own
   userspace (see :ref:`Filters <filters>` and :ref:`Controllers <controllers>`)

* Blogofile is **secure**, there's nothing executable on the server `to exploit <http://wordpress.org/news/2010/12/3-0-4-update/>`_.
* Blogofile works **offline**, with a built-in web server you can work on your site from anywhere.
* Blogofile is **file based**, so you can edit it with your favorite text editor, not some crappy web interface.
* Seamless :ref:`Git Integration <vcs-integration>`. Publish to your blog with a simple ``git push``. This also makes **backups** dirt simple.

Installing Blogofile
====================

Python Versions
---------------

Blogofile is being developed under Python_ 3.2
and tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/


Prerequisites
-------------

Apart from one of the Python versions listed above,
you will also need one of the Python packaging libraries that supports
:mod:`setuptools` style entry points; i.e. distribute_ or setuptools_.

.. _distribute: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
.. _setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Using a Python virtualenv_ is strongly recommended to segregate
Blogofile and the packages it depends on from your system Python
installation.
It has the added advantage of taking care of the packaging library issue
for you too.
